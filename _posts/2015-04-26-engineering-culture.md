title: Engineering culture

Lately there is a lot being said about Engineering culture. How to retain talent, how to attract talent, how to be productive, deliver fast and deliver great products.

Software engineering is a tough and special world. So many things have been said around SE and this is a story to be continued, because continuous improvement is part of SE.
We need to be agile in our development process, because *Agile* is about reacting quickly to change.
In my opinion *companies need to be Agile* as well. Let me for a second invent a metaphor:

```We have been able to replace any mechanical part in our computers. Before we used to have discs everywhere, diskettes to store some info.
We have been able to create Flash drives to replace those to be faster. We have hard drives as discs that spin to access more thatn 1 TB of data, slowly they are been replaced with SSD drives.
One of the latest slow parts of the computer is the DVD drive, still a disc that spins. We are seeing the ussage of DVD being reduced, not far from now we'll see that DVD drives are over.
In a system every part needs to be syncronized, even if most of things in the computer are fast, it won't fully work if we have a single weak point.```

If we compare a company with a system, if we try to do changes to react quickly to changes, it won't be that effective as if we do changes in the entire organization.
Can you imagine a company where all, Marketing, Engineering, Finance, HR, Exectutive team, work using Agile, reacting quickly to change?
It would be like a computer with cutting-edge technology, all working at the speed of light, every piece ready to react quickly to changes and actions carried out by the user.

I believe that we'll se a big change in the IT world. Because after all, every company that deliver content to users is heavily based on the Engineering deparment. If doesn't make sense that we in Engineering addopt Continuous Delivery and Agile, whilst the rest of the company is still using monolyth classic systems, that react really slow to change.
One could say that the paradigm I'm describing is only suitable for start ups and small companies. In my opinion even big companies can embrace these things.

Here are a couple of videos about Spotify and their Engineering Culture, enjoy!
