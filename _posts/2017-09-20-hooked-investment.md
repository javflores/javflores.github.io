title: Hooked, Investment
---

## Remember this:

- **Investment is the fourth phase of the Hook Model**. Unlike the action phase, which delivers immediate gratification, the investment phase concern the anticipation of rewards in the future.

- **Investment in a product create preferences because of our tendency to overvalue our work, be consistent with past behaviors and avoid cognitive dissonance** (difficult things are made seem worthless by our brain).

- **Investment comes after the variable reward phase, when users are primed to reciprocate**. 

- **Investments increase the likelihood of users returning by improving the service the more it is used. They enable the accrual of stored value in the form of content, data, followers, reputation or skill.

- **Investments increase the likelihood of users passing through the Hook again by loading the next trigger to start the cycle all over again.

## Do this now:

- **What bit of work are your users doing to increase their likelihood of returning**?.

  - Enter their race goal
  - Enter training preferences: time, days, day by sport, number of hours.
  - Initial assesment of fitness abilities.
  - Continuous assesment of abilities.
  - Complete workouts.
  - If not completed, workouts and periods are recalculated (reward?)
  - If not ready, change race or make a decission whether to race or not.
  
- **Three ways to add small invesments into your product to:**
  - **Load the next trigger**: All the above can load external triggers enquiring user to go through the next cycle (for example in the initial setup). A trigger to check fitness can be loaded after user completes a workout/ sets RPE and write comments of a workout. Social triggers could be enabled by using training comments.
  - **Store value as data, content, reputation and skill**: Data as completed training so they can revisit the training they did for a given race by going to the app; content generated in the form of comments of workouts, sycologigal tests,... (it could even be that we have a comunity that help each other, thus generating content); skill as you progress in the training (training skills and abilities can be made gamified, also have a users rank as they progress through the periods).
  
- **Identify how long it takes for a "loaded trigger" to reengage your users.** No hook cycle at the moment
