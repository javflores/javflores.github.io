## Remember this:

- **To help you as a designer of habit-forming technology, assess the morality behind how you manipulate users, it is helpful to determine which of the four catagories your work fits into. Are you a facilitator, peddler, entertainer or dealer?**

- **Facilitators** use their own product and believe it can materially improve people's live. They have the highest chance of success because they most closely understand the needs of their users.

- **Peddlers** believe their product can materially improve people's lives but do not use it themshelves. They must beware of the hubris and inauthenticity that comes from building solutions for people they do not understand firsthand.

- **Entertainers** use their product but do not believe it can improve people's live. They can be succesful, but without making the lives of others better in some way, the entertainers products often lack staying power.

- **Dealers** neither use the product nor they think it can improve people's live. They have the lowest chance of finding long-term success and often find themselves in morally precarious positions.
