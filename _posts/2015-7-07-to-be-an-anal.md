title: To be an an anal
---

9.00 AM I arrive to the office like any other day, I have just run to there like any other day. I am going to have a shower when another Technical Lead tells me:

_-Could I talk to you for a moment? It is about the code review you did yesterday for my team, you are being an anal in this code._
_- Excuse me, an anal?_
_- Yes, the whole team thinks like that. Your comments are minor details and we don't have time to fix that. We will add a refactoring ticket later on but we need to get this work finished._

I start sweating, what's going on? Juan Antonio, you don't even know what to be an anal is, certainly not something good.
I search for the definition. Urban dictionary:

> When someone is being anal about something, he is choosing to be an asshole. He is choosing to be tight and strong minded like the anal sphincter. Therefore, you tell him; "Don't be anal".

Ok, let's try another source, Urban Dictionary is not very precise sometimes. Merrian dictionary:

> Extremely or overly neat, careful, or precise.

Let's go back in time a bit.
