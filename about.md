Hi there! I´m Juan Antonio. I studied Teleco Engineering, you know... a lot of stuff about electro waves, radiation, networks, physics. It had some programming and one day just by chance I started to work as a software developer. You don´t know where life can take you but I´m really glad that it happened. I was really lucky, I started in a company that takes a lot of care to software quality, I was surrounded by great colleagues and I could learn a lot from them. 

It all turned me into a passionate developer, I like my job, I like learning and sharing. I´m interested in clean code, software design, cutting-edge technologies. I love .Net but I´m trying to make it with JS, everybody deserves an opportunity.

I like learning from others, I like sharing what I learn. I started this blog because I miss my Agresso colleagues, talking about code with them. This blog could make it feel closer with them.
